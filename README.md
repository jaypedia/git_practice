# Git practice

This is a repository for git practice for collaboration.

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

### Undoing Things

One of the common undos takes place when you commit too early and possibly forget to add some files, or you mess up your commit message. If you want to redo that commit, make the additional changes you forgot, stage them, and commit again using the --amend option.

```
git commit --amend
```
